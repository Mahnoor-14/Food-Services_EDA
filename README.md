# Food-Services_EDA

ðŸ“Š Project Overview

This project aims to analyze patterns and factors influencing food waste in a kitchen or cafeteria setting. It uses **statistical analysis**, **visualizations**, and **correlation techniques** to uncover trends related to:

* Kitchen staff experience and number
* Weather conditions (temperature, humidity)
* Special events
* Food waste categories (e.g., meat, dairy, vegetables)

Key Analyses Performed

### 1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**

* Missing values handled
* Encoded categorical variables (e.g., staff experience levels)

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

* Histograms, boxplots, violin plots for staff and waste patterns
* Seasonal analysis of food waste
* Scatterplots and pairwise relationships

### 3. **Hypothesis Testing**

* **ANOVA**: Checked if staff experience affects food waste
* **T-Test**: Compared waste during special events vs. regular days
* **Correlation tests**: Studied relationships between waste and environmental factors

### 4. **Time Series & Seasonal Trends**

* Examined monthly trends in temperature and food waste
* Heatmaps and dual-axis plots for better visualization

### 5. **Staffing Insight**

* Found optimal kitchen staff count (16â€“17) for reduced food waste
* Weak negative correlation between staff count and waste

## ðŸ“Œ Key Findings

* **Kitchen staff size** (16â€“17) is associated with more consistent and lower food waste.
* **Staff experience level** alone does **not significantly** impact food waste.
* **Temperature** shows weak positive correlation with waste â€” possibly due to spoilage.
* **Special events** do not significantly increase waste statistically, though seasonal visual analysis suggests higher summer/winter event waste.

## ðŸ’¡ Recommendations

* Schedule 16â€“17 staff during high meal periods for optimal efficiency.
* Improve cold storage and food preservation during hotter months.
* Implement waste-reduction strategies during special events (donations, portion controls).
* Monitor staff training for specific waste categories like dairy or meat.
